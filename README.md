# SfCheats
SPOILERS GALORE! THIS IS FOR GAME RE-PLAYERS.

A collection of starfield cheat scripts that reduce grinding for PC players.
_RHF_Cheat_Instructions_ReadMe_

Xbox users can't use any of these. Play on a PC to take advantage. Your Xbox license will entitle a PC version.

PC Players: After you play Starfield all the way through without cheating, you should try the shortcuts available with cheat codes.
The game is highly re-playable if you don't have to grind. 
True, you will sacrifice "achievements", but you will have already earned them in your original playthrough, or learn to forget about them. You will see more content this way and get more value.
Build amazing ships and outposts. Credits (and skills) are no longer an obstacle. Do everything the game is made to do.

I have assembled my collection of bat files as a Zip. The scripts in  the attached "SfCheats.zip" should be expanded in your PC's  […documents/games/starfield/] directory. 
They are all text files. They are executed with PC console: ~, "bat [filename]" do NOT include the file extension in your command (don't add ".txt"). 
EXAMPLE: tap tilde ~ key, type "bat SfCheatAllNew" [enter], then [esc] to cancel console. The example script will give you enormous wealth and power with which to start the game.

IMHO one really should mod as well. These are my essentials.
(Creations): Some are pay to download. I wouldn't play without them.

	Darkstar Astrodynamics
		Better ships with ridiculously powerful weapons, and excellent outpost components.
  	Auto-solve Temple Puzzles
		No temple grind for your first and then Barrett's mission. You will already have all the other powers at level 10 if you run my start scripts. (I hate temple grinds.)
	Luxurious Ship Habs
		Comfort and beauty in space! Yeah. A pool! The crew seems to love the pool.
	Shade's Deluxe Dynamic Boostpacks
		Essential for maximum fun. Read the instructions, and also buy the controller at one of the listed stores. Again: Read the instructions. 
		After you activate the backpack device, the control appears as a weapon. Put that in your favorites, activate to fly. Against author's recommended defaults, I make settings "no restrictions" to fly in towns. Just save first in case of regret.
		Once you  are a flier, take a high flight and conjure your favorite ship EXAMPLE:"Player.placeatme 000F3076", then fly to it's door, choose the door by scrolling, open the door with console command "unlock" and take over the ship. Any ship is yours for this minimal effort. You can afford to buy them now too, but this method lets you collect more types.
	Sub-orbital Shuttle SOS-8
		Fly above the fray. Essential for Sam's artifact mission and essential for Varuun DLC 'Shattered Space'. Companions make funny remarks about your flying skills.
	Skinthetics by Enhance!
		Give yourself the looks of your favorite NPC.
		Build a collection of attractive action figures to populate your habs and structures. (Skinthetica Mannequins)
		Change the looks of your companions to suit you better.
		Don't forget to save a copy of your start looks if you plan to go back. 
	Digipick Skip
		Open sesame! Spring all doors and locks with a touch. Essential.
	Paradiso Cabin as Outpost Structure - Redone
		Create comfortable places to crash for the NPCs that you assign to your outposts, (Lin and Heller at the least).
	Mattell's Cockpits and Bridges Crew Series.
		The lux habs don't give enough crew space. These make up for it, and mount more weapons.
	

Cheat "max fun" pointers:	

NEW GAME: Run "bat SFCheatAllNew" is a setup bat you should run when you first see daylight on your walk to see Barrett for the first time.
	Shoot some grenades into the pirate ship when it lands. Nobody else has to get hurt.
In NG+ games: run "bat SfCheatNGsetup" when you wake up on the Starborn ship.
	In both cases, organize your inventory right away. Build your "favorites" for quick access.
	Before you leave Vectera (new game) build a DSA Terminus in the out country. Alternatively you can do it on the moon just before facing the pirates at the building. Using terminus tools, Upgrade your Mark1 Space suit, helmet and pack. Add Dynamic Boost Pack III. 
	Build a new ship that is kick ass. Add the most powerful weapons. Now back to the mission...Drop right in on the pirates and blow them to smithereens.
